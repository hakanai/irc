A simple (and old...) IRC bot framework.

I dusted this off as it was in my subversion repository, is in a relatively usable state,
and might be useful for my other bot-related project later.

Licence for the time being is GPLv3.

Building:

  Just run ant from the base directory.

Using:

  1. In the conf directory, take a copy of the example config file and name it SimpleBot.xml

  2. Adjust the parameters.

  3. Run ./bot from the bin directory.
